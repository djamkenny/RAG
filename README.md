# YouTube Video Analyzer

## Description

YouTube Video Analyzer is a web application that allows users to analyze YouTube videos by providing a video URL. The application fetches data from a server and returns an analysis formatted in HTML. This analysis is displayed to the user, making it easy to read and understand.

## Features

- Input a YouTube video URL and select a region.
- Fetches and displays video analysis.
- Renders analysis content as safe HTML.
- Error handling for invalid URLs or server errors.
  
## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- HTML/CSS: For styling the application.
- Fetch API: To make requests to the backend.
- Node.js/Express: (Specify if you have a backend code) For serving the analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-video-analyzer.git
   cd youtube-video-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Backend Setup** (if applicable):
   If you have a backend server to fetch analysis data, set it up by navigating to its directory and running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Make sure the server is running at the specified endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/analyze`).
